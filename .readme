I used mongo databases, and node packages to create this app.
I used the itunes_user_auth files as a template and built my project off of that.
When deploying my project I ran into issues... The login and signup buttons aren't working
because of what seems to be an error in connecting to the local host? This is an issue
I haven't been able to resolve as of yet...
